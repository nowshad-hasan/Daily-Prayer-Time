# Daily-Prayer-Time
A chrome extension to show the **5 Prayer Times** in _Analog Style Clock._

## Overview
Did you ever miss any prayer because of _Internet Surfing_, _Facebook Scrolling_, _Youtube Playing?_ Don't you? But I did. Then I 
made up a plan to set a reminder on my browser. I made a **_Chrome Extension_** to give notification on the prayer time.

## Features
When someone installs this extension, **by default** it sets the prayer time from https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api.
 But it may be different from place to place, So, I put an option for _Manual Timing_. Click on **Settings** button
and go to the **Options** page. Set your area's prayer time, then click on **Save Settings**. And **_BINGO!_**

It'll notify you in the manual time setup. You can also add timing in _minutes_ before you want to get the notification.
Again, you can turn _On/Off_ your notification sound. But after all these changes, you must click on 'Save Settings' button
to save the changes. **Reset Default** button is also here to reset all settings as before! For further  knowing, click on 
**Instructions** button.
